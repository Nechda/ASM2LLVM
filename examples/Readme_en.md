There are some examples that demonstrates basic opportunities the binary translator:
* sum.asm - just calculates a sum of two numbers, entered from the keyboard.
* factorial.asm - evaluates factorial of a number, it's implemented by loops.
* simple_stack.asm - multiplies two numbers, located at the top of a stack.
